
Prove the following theorem.

\begin{theorem*}[Optimality of extreme points] 
	\small
	Let $P = \braces{x \in \reals^n : Ax \geq b}$ be a polyhedral set and $c \in \reals^n$. Consider the problem 
	\begin{equation*}
		z = \mini\braces{c^\top x : x \in P}.					
	\end{equation*}
	Suppose that $P$ has at least one extreme point and that there exists an optimal solution. Then, there exists an optimal solution that is an extreme point of $P$.
\end{theorem*}

Note: see Exercise 3.1.
