Let $x$ be a point in a polyhedron $P=\braces{x \in \reals^n : Ax =  b, x \ge 0}$. Show that a vector $d \in \reals^n$ is a feasible direction at $x \in P$ if and only if $ Ad = 0$ and $d_i\ge 0$ for all $i$ for which $x_i = 0$.  A feasible direction of $P$ at point $x$ is a vector $d \neq 0$ such that $x + \theta d \in P$ for some $\theta > 0$.
