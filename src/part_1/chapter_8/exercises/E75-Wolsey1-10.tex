A set of $N = \{1,\dots,n\}$ jobs must be carried out on a single machine that can do only one job at a time. Each job $j\in N$ takes $p_j$ hours to complete. Given job weights $w_j$ for all $j\in N$, in what order should the jobs be carried out so as to minimise the weighted sum of their start times? Formulate this scheduling problem as a mixed integer-programming problem. 

%\emph{Hint:} Use variables $t_j \geq 0$ to represent start times of each job $j$, and variables $x_{ij} \in \{0,1\}$ with $x_{ij} = 1$ if job $i$ precedes job $j$ and $x_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.
