Prove the following theorem.

\begin{theorem*}[Inverses, linear independence, and solving $Ax = b$]
	Let $A$ be a $m \times m$ matrix. Then, the following statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $A$ is invertible
		\item $A^\top$ is invertible
		\item The determinant of $A$ is nonzero
		\item The rows of $A$ are linearly independent
		\item The columns of $A$ are linearly independent
		\item For every $b \in \reals^m$, the linear system $Ax = b$ has a unique solution
		\item There exists some $b \in \reals^m$ such that $Ax = b$ has a unique solution.
