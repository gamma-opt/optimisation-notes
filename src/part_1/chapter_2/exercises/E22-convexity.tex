Prove the following theorem.

\begin{theorem*}[Convexity of polyhedral sets] 
	%	\vspace{-3pt}
	\emph{The following convexity properties about convex sets can be said:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The intersection of convex sets is convex
		\item Every polyhedral set is a convex set
		\item A convex combination of a finite number of elements of a convex set also belongs to that set
		\item The convex hull of a finite number of elements is a convex set.			
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem*}

Note: the proof of the theorem is proved in the notes. Use this as an opportunity to revisit the proof carefully, and try to take as many steps without consulting the text as you can. This is a great exercise to help you internalise the proof and its importance in the context of this book. I strongly advise against blindly memorising it, as I suspect you will never (in my courses, at least) be requested to recite the proof literally.
