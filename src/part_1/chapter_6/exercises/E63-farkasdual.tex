Use the Farkas' lemma to prove the duality theorem for a linear programming problem involving constraints of the form $a'_ix = b_i, a'_ix \geq b_i$, and nonegativity constraints for some of the variables $x_j$. \emph{Hint}: Start by deriving the form of the set of feasible directions at an optimal solution.
