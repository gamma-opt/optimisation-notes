\noindent Consider the standard-form linear programming problem:
\begin{align*}
	(P) : \mini & c^\top x \\
	\st & Ax = b \\
				& x \ge 0,
\end{align*}
where $A \in \reals^{m \times n}$ and $b \in \reals^m$. Show that if $P$ has a finite optimal solution, then the new problem $\overline{P}$ obtained from $P$ by replacing the right-hand side vector $b$ with another one $\bar{b} \in \reals^m$ cannot be unbounded no matter what value the components of $\bar{b}$ can take.
