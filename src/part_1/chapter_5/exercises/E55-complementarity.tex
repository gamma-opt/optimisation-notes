Recall the paint factory problem introduced in Section \ref{section_121}.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Construct the dual of the problem below and solve both the original problem and its dual. 
\item[(b)] Use complementary slackness to verify that the primal and dual solutions are optimal.
\end{itemize}
