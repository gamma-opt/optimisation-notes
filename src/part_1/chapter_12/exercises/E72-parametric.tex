Recall the paint factory problem 
%
\begin{align}
	\maxi z = \ & 5x + 4y\\
	\st & 6x + 4y \leq 24\\
	& x + 2y \leq 6 \\
	& y - x \leq  1 \\
	& y \leq 2 \\
	& x, y \geq 0.
\end{align}
%

\begin{itemize} 
    \item[(a)] Formulate a parametric optimization problem $F(x)$, maximizing the profit from selling interior paint ($y$) given the amount of exterior paint ($x$) produced. The solution to this problem must be feasible to the full paint factory problem.
    \item[(b)] Solve the paint factory problem using Benders decomposition. Use $x$ as the main problem variable and $y$ as the subproblem variable.
\end{itemize}
