## About

This repository contains the lecture notes that have been prepared for graduate level courses at Aalto University. 
- MS-E2121 - Linear optimisation
- MS-E2122 - Nonlinear optimisation

These lecture notes were written by [Fabricio Oliveira](https://gamma-opt.aalto.fi/author/fabricio-oliveira/) based on the following references:

**Part 1**
- Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis (2008), Introduction to Linear Optimization, 2nd edition, Athena Scientific
- Wolsey (2020), Integer Programming, 2nd edition, Wiley

**Part 2**
- Bazaraa, Sherali, and Shetty (1993), Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms, 3rd edition, Wiley
- Boyd and Vandenberghe (2004), Convex Optimization, 1st edition, Cambridge University Press
- Bertsekas (2016), Nonlinear Programming, 3rd edition, Athena Scientific

Though I wrote those, these were improved by the work of many people to whom I am forever thankful, including but not limited to:
- Juho Andelmin
- Nikita Belyak
- Lucas Condeixa
- Olli Herrala
- many TAs and students.


## Contributing

The material is constantly developing and therefore, subject to error and typos. If you find anything that you suspect to be a problem, please post an [issue](https://github.com/gamma-opt/optimisation-notes/issues) describing where the problem is and how to solve it. Even better, if you are confident with Githb (or would like to try it out) you can file a [pull request](https://github.com/gamma-opt/optimisation-notes/pulls) directly!
