## About

This repository contains the lecture notes that have been prepared for graduate level courses at Aalto University. 
- MS-E2121 - Linear Optimisation
- MS-E2122 - Nonlinear optimisation

At the moment it is a **work in progress** as the Part 1 notes will be finished during the 2022 Spring edition of MS-E2121. These are used for the courses. These lecture notes were written by [Fabricio Oliveira](https://gamma-opt.aalto.fi/author/fabricio-oliveira/) based on the following references:

**Part 1**
- Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis (2008), Introduction to Linear Optimization, 2nd edition, Athena Scientific
- Wolsey (2020), Integer Programming, 2nd edition, Wiley

**Part 2**
- Bazaraa, Sherali, and Shetty (1993), Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms, 3rd edition, Wiley
- Boyd and Vandenberghe (2004), Convex Optimization, 1st edition, Cambridge University Press
- Bertsekas (2016), Nonlinear Programming, 3rd edition, Athena Scientific


Though I wrote those, these were improved by the work of many people to whom I am forever thankful, including but not limited to:
- Juho Andelmin
- Nikita Belyak
- Lucas Condeixa
- Olli Herrala
- many TAs and students.

If you find anything that you suspect to be a problem, please post an [issue](https://github.com/gamma-opt/optimisation-notes/issues) describing where the problem is and how to solve it. Even better, if you are confident with Githb (or would lie to try it out) you can file a [pull request](https://github.com/gamma-opt/optimisation-notes/pulls) directly! 


## Discussion forum

Associated with the material, we have a forum about the content of the notes in the [Discussion](https://github.com/gamma-opt/optimisation-notes/discussions) section. If you have any questions about the material, a good starting point is to search the forum. We also curate it with questions students ask, so you might find your answer there. Otherwise, feel free to post questions related to the material.

Notice that questions related to any of the assessments of the courses should be ask in the appropriate channels. The questions in the forum are exclusively for **the lecture's content**.
